Table of Contents

1. Executive Summary
You've Been Heard is a triple-threat platform for mid-market IT leaders: a top-ranked podcast, a private peer community of 181+ CTOs and CIOs, and a vendor-neutral technology advisory powered by $1.2 billion in buying power. The business generates 100% of its leads through a podcast-driven pipeline. This document defines the strategy to amplify that pipeline, open parallel entry points, and systematically convert the 9-year content library and 390+ episode archive into a revenue-generating marketing engine.

1.1 The Core Insight
The podcast pipeline works. IT leaders accept invitations to be guests, go through a pre-podcast onboarding process that naturally surfaces pain points and contract timing, record an episode, receive a high-value Personal Recognition Framework (PRF) deliverable, and then a meaningful percentage convert to advisory engagements. The problem is not the pipeline itself but that it operates in isolation: the PRF has no CTAs driving to advisory services, 9 years of content sits unused after release day, and the advisory's strongest proof points (like $1.872M in savings for Trinity Health Centers) are buried in LinkedIn Experience sections instead of being featured on the website.

1.2 What This Strategy Does
Restructures all marketing around the podcast as the primary engine, with campaigns as amplifiers, not replacements.
Defines 7 PRF sidebar CTAs that convert podcast guests and their networks into advisory prospects (detailed design in separate project).
Creates a content repurposing engine that transforms each episode into 15-20 pieces of social content, tagging guests to stay visible and remind them of advisory services.
Builds vertical-specific entry points (Vendor Reality Briefs, scorecards, roundtables) for BOTH existing podcast guests who haven't yet engaged with advisory AND new prospects who haven't entered the podcast funnel. The 350+ past guests represent a massive untapped pool of warm leads who already trust the brand but were never given a clear path to advisory services.
Establishes lead scoring, CRM automation, and email nurture sequences in Go High Level.
Optimizes LinkedIn profiles (Phil and all reps) as conversion assets, not just brand placeholders.
Fixes critical infrastructure issues: broken website links, outdated messaging, missing tracking.

1.3 Priority Order
Phase A (Immediate, $0 cost): Fix broken advisory link on website, add CTAs to PRF, update website advisory section with real case studies and proof, optimize LinkedIn profiles.
Phase B (Weeks 1-4): Build content repurposing workflow, deploy first Vendor Reality Brief and scorecard, launch email re-engagement of 350 podcast guest list and 6K general list.
Phase C (Weeks 4-8): Launch first roundtable series, build vertical landing pages, deploy GHL automation and lead scoring, expand to additional verticals.
Phase D (Weeks 8-12): Scale content engine, activate LinkedIn Events play, evaluate paid advertising based on organic performance data.
Phase E (Post-Foundation): CEO/CFO avatar expansion, paid LinkedIn ads, podcast audio ad optimization, partnership and event-based lead generation.

2. Business Model Architecture
The You've Been Heard platform operates as an interconnected triple-threat system. Each pillar feeds the others. The podcast creates trust and surfaces needs. The community retains relationships and generates referrals. The advisory converts relationships into revenue. Understanding this architecture is essential because every marketing action must serve at least one pillar without undermining another.

2.1 Pillar 1: Podcast (Top of Funnel)
The podcast is the primary lead generation engine. 390+ episodes with mid-market IT leaders (CTO, CIO, VP of IT, IT Director) published 3 episodes per week. Each guest goes through a structured recruitment and onboarding process that naturally captures qualification data. The podcast establishes Phil and YBH as the trusted platform for IT leadership conversations, providing brand credibility that no amount of advertising could replicate.

Podcast Economics
Each episode represents a significant investment in time and production. Reps spend hours on LinkedIn outreach to recruit qualified guests. The pre-podcast onboarding call, recording session, and PRF production add further cost. The return on this investment depends entirely on how effectively YBH converts attention into advisory engagements, which is why the PRF CTAs and content repurposing engine are the highest-leverage improvements available.

2.2 Pillar 2: Community (Retention and Peer Network)
The Circle community includes 181+ CTOs, CIOs, and senior IT leaders. It is vendor-free by design, providing a trusted space for sanity-checking decisions, peer collaboration, and roundtable discussions. The community functions as ongoing trust maintenance: guests who join after their podcast recording stay connected to the YBH ecosystem long after their episode airs. It is also a credibility validator, because when a prospect evaluates YBH, seeing 181+ senior IT leaders already engaged provides powerful social proof.

Community Value Proposition
The Gartner comparison is a potent positioning tool. Gartner charges $60,000 to $120,000 per year for analyst access. The YBH community provides peer-level vendor intelligence, sanity checks, and decision validation at no cost. This framing makes the community invitation nearly irresistible for qualified IT leaders.

2.3 Pillar 3: Advisory (Revenue Engine)
The advisory is where revenue is generated. Phil conducts one-on-one discovery sessions, captures detailed requirements, engages vendors through channel partnerships, and builds comprehensive multi-vendor analysis deliverables. These analyses include financial summaries with 3-year TCO modeling, remediation and technology comparisons, weighted scoring matrices, and compliance mapping. The advisory manages the full lifecycle from evaluation through negotiation, implementation, and ongoing management.

Advisory Differentiators
Vendor-funded through channel partnerships. No cost to the client.
$1.2 billion in aggregate buying power through CSP and TSD relationships.
Performance-first, not profit-first. Bad advice costs YBH money because the model depends on decisions holding up long term.
Cradle-to-grave lifecycle management. YBH does not disappear after the recommendation.
9,000+ MSP network plus direct CSP partnerships for best-in-class vendor matching.

2.4 The Flywheel
Podcast creates trust and surfaces needs. Advisory solves those needs and generates revenue. Solved needs become case studies. Case studies attract more podcast guests. Guests join the community. Community members refer peers who become podcast guests. This cycle is self-reinforcing but currently under-leveraged because content stops circulating after release day and case studies are not systematically shared.

3. Current State Assessment
3.1 What Is Working
Podcast pipeline generates 100% of current leads. Recruitment-to-recording process is proven and repeatable.
Phil's video explanation of the brand and process removes selling burden from reps and delivers consistent messaging.
3 pre-podcast questions (seat vs. heard, what fires you up, 18-month tech prediction) serve dual purpose: content preparation and engagement qualification.
Pre-podcast onboarding deck Slide 12 'Quick Sanity Check' captures pain points, contract timing, tech stack, vendor relationships, AI interest, and budget reality.
PRF 3.0 delivers high-value, timeless content (infographics, carousels, quote cards, video frameworks, article bases) that guests use for years.
Advisory deliverables are extraordinarily comprehensive (see Coleman Health MSSP analysis: 6 tabs, weighted CISO scoring, 3-year TCO, CMMC compliance mapping).
LinkedIn profile (17,862 followers) generates organic inbound through strong positioning and DMs welcome CTA.
Community (181+ members) provides genuine peer value and strong social proof.
350 podcast guest email list has 45% open rate, proving high engagement with the brand.

3.2 Critical Issues Found






4. Sales Process Flow (Corrected)
This section documents the actual current sales process as validated on February 2, 2026. This replaces any previous flowcharts or documentation that may reference the old questionnaire format.

4.1 Stage 1: Targeting
Reps use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to build prospect lists with the following filters:
Title: IT Director, CTO, CIO, VP of IT, VP of Technology, Director of Information Systems
Company Size: Mid-market (Fortune 5000), multi-location preferred
Industries: Healthcare, retail, logistics, manufacturing, construction
Exclusions: No companies in alcohol, banking/interest-based finance, insurance, or pork industries
Priority Flags: New to role in last 90 days (evaluating everything, most receptive), active on LinkedIn (will respond to DMs)

4.2 Stage 2: LinkedIn Outreach
Connection request is personal and references their profile, not templated. After connection is accepted:
Follow-up message: 'TY for connecting, I recruit IT leaders for the Podcast You've Been Heard, thought you'd be a good fit to be on the show. Is this of any interest to you? Yes, No, Maybe?'
If no response: Voice note, meme/quote, or provocative question.
Multi-touch cadence: Email #1, phone/VM, Email #2, Email #3 (breakup). All signed as 'Behind the Scenes Coordinator.'
Reps are positioned as coordinators, not salespeople. This removes sales pressure and positions the podcast invitation as a peer recognition opportunity.

4.3 Stage 3: Interest Captured
When a prospect expresses interest:
Send link to Phil's video explaining the brand, the podcast experience, and the platform value.
Guest watches video, then answers 3 questions:

Q1: 'Thoughts on having a seat versus actually being heard?'
Q2: 'What fires you up about your role?'
Q3: 'What's a prediction people will be talking about in tech 18 months from now that they are not today?'

Book on rep's calendar for pre-podcast onboarding call.
Enter into CRM with address, mobile, email.


4.4 Stage 4: Pre-Podcast Onboarding Call
Rep runs the onboarding presentation deck. However, simply showing the wheel and walking through slides is not generating advisory leads at the rate it should. The slides provide context, but the real discovery happens through direct, conversational questions that surface pain and urgency. Reps must be trained to ask better questions throughout the call, not just on Slide 12.

Upgraded Discovery Questions (Weave Throughout the Call)
These questions should feel natural and conversational, not like an interrogation. Reps should introduce them with framing like 'Before we get into the recording logistics, I'm curious about something...' or 'One thing our guests often tell us is...'

Executive Pressure: 'What are you being pressured to do right now by executive management? Are there specific mandates or timelines?'
Cost Cutting: 'Are you being tasked to cut costs this year? If so, where is the pressure coming from, and what's the target?'
Telecom and CX: 'What are you doing for telecom right now? Contact center? Are you happy with it, or is it one of those things that just kind of sits there?'
Vendor Inventory: 'When was the last time you did a general vendor inventory check to make sure what you're paying for still matches how your business actually operates today?'
Pain Points: 'What's the loudest thing in your world right now, vendor-wise or infrastructure-wise?'
Contract Timing: 'Any major contracts coming up for renewal in the next 6-12 months?'
Tech Stack: 'Walk me through the big buckets: Internet, Firewall/Security, Microsoft, Telecom/CX, Mobile Device Carriers. Anything keeping you up at night in any of those?'
Vendor Frustration: 'Any vendors right now that are just not earning their paycheck?'
AI Pressure: 'What's your take on the pressure to implement AI? Anyone in the C-suite asking you to figure it out?'
Budget: 'Any cost center pressure to optimize, or room to reinvest if you could prove savings?'

Standard Call Agenda
Review guest's thoughts and passions (from the 3 questions).
Preview the PRF 3.0: AI + human workflow extracting strongest ideas, mapping to trending IT topics, creating timeless content. Show live demo.
Discovery questions woven naturally through conversation (above).
Invite to join the community (181+ CTOs/CIOs, vendor-free, roundtables, live sessions).
Schedule the recording (4 hosts available, 45-60 minutes, unscripted, recorded in community where peers may join live).
Collect social media handles (LinkedIn primary, Twitter/X, YouTube, website/blog).
General intake form.


Slides 7-11 introduce the advisory without hard-selling it. The framing is: 'This is completely optional and not why we're meeting today.' The advisory is presented as a natural extension of the platform's mission to help IT leaders make better decisions.

4.5 Stage 5: Podcast Recording
45-60 minutes, unscripted, recorded within the Circle community. Peers can join the live recording and participate. One of four hosts conducts the conversation. Recording quality and production value are consistently praised in reviews.

4.6 Stage 6: PRF Delivery and Follow-Up
After recording, the PRF 3.0 is produced and delivered. This includes executive insights, infographics, carousels, quote cards, video short frameworks, and article bases the guest can use for their personal brand for years.

The PRF should include 7 sidebar CTAs (defined in this strategy, detailed design in separate project). After delivery:
Ask for a review and sharing.
Ask: 'Do you need help with anything? Vendor management, internet, telecom, Microsoft licensing, cloud strategy?'
If interest expressed or need identified from the Sanity Check, transition to advisory engagement.


4.7 Stage 7: Advisory Engagement
When a prospect expresses interest or a need is identified:
Phil conducts one-on-one discovery session.
Phil sends notes to channel manager.
Channel manager recommends vendors and registers opportunities with vendors of choice. Phil may also direct-register with vendors he knows well.
If the topic is outside Phil's core expertise, sales engineering is engaged to help find the right vendors and create a shortlist.
Vendors respond with proposals. If the client has their own RFQ, Phil advises on it and forwards to relevant vendors.
Phil builds comprehensive multi-vendor analysis (financial summary, remediation comparison, technology comparison, weighted scoring, compliance mapping).
Phil presents analysis to client and manages the selection process.
Phil manages implementation lifecycle: does not disappear after the recommendation.


Phil's Language Extraction Plan (Building the Playbook)
Starting immediately, begin recording and transcribing Phil's 1:1 discovery calls and advisory conversations (with client permission). The goal is to build a library of Phil's exact language, frameworks, objection handling, and question sequences so reps can eventually replicate the advisory conversation. This is not about replacing Phil but about removing him as the sole bottleneck.

Record all 1:1 discovery calls (Zoom/phone with transcription enabled).
Extract the specific phrases, questions, and transitions Phil uses naturally. Examples: how he introduces the vendor-neutral positioning, how he asks about contract timing without sounding salesy, how he handles 'we already have a vendor for that' objections.
Catalog by category: opening questions, pain discovery, vendor frustration probes, advisory pitch framing, objection handling, closing for next steps.
Build a 'Phil's Playbook' document that reps study. Not a script but a framework with real examples of language that works.
Role-play training sessions where reps practice using Phil's frameworks on simulated calls.
At the $1M revenue milestone, begin having senior reps shadow Phil on live 1:1 calls, then gradually handle discovery portions with Phil joining for the advisory pitch.

AI tools can accelerate this: transcription services (Otter.ai, Fireflies) auto-transcribe calls, and Claude can analyze transcripts to extract patterns, common questions, and effective phrases. The integrator should set up an automated pipeline: call recorded, transcribed, key phrases tagged, added to the playbook library.


5. Target Audience and Qualification
5.1 Primary Avatar: IT Leader

5.2 Priority Qualifiers
New to Role (Last 90 Days): IT leaders who recently stepped into a new position are evaluating everything: vendors, contracts, infrastructure, team. They are the most receptive to both the podcast invitation (fresh perspective to share) and advisory services (need a second set of eyes immediately). This is the top-tier filter in Sales Navigator.
Active on LinkedIn: Leaders who post, comment, or engage on LinkedIn are more likely to respond to connection requests and DMs. This is a secondary but important filter.
Contract Renewal Approaching: Captured during the Quick Sanity Check (Slide 12). If a major contract renews in the next 6-12 months, the advisory conversation becomes immediately relevant. This data should trigger time-based follow-up sequences in GHL (90/60/30 day reminders).

5.3 Alternative Prospecting Channels (Beyond the Podcast)
Reps are asking for ways to reach prospects beyond the podcast invitation. The podcast remains the primary engine, but these additional channels give reps more tools in the toolbox and catch prospects who may not be natural podcast guests.

Intent Data and Warm Lead Lists (ZoomInfo / Bombora / 6sense)
Intent data platforms identify companies actively researching specific topics (cybersecurity vendors, SD-WAN providers, Microsoft licensing, cloud migration). These are buying signals that indicate a company is evaluating options right now. The play:
Subscribe to an intent data provider (ZoomInfo with intent signals is the most common for mid-market). Evaluate pricing against expected ROI before committing.
Build weekly warm lead lists filtered by: target title (CTO/CIO/VP IT), target industry (healthcare, retail, logistics, manufacturing, construction), and active intent signals in YBH's verticals (cybersecurity, Microsoft, network, telecom, cloud).
Reps call from YBH (not as salespeople) with a survey-style approach: 'We're conducting a quick industry survey on [topic they're researching]. Would you be willing to answer 2-3 questions? In exchange, we'll give you a free vendor evaluation or a spotlight feature on our podcast for IT leaders.'
If they answer the survey: capture the data (feeds the same discovery fields as the onboarding call), offer the free evaluation or podcast spotlight, and route into the appropriate pipeline.
If they decline the survey but accept the podcast invitation: standard podcast pipeline.
If they decline everything: add to nurture list for email content.


Referral Engine
Every podcast guest and advisory client should be asked for referrals. This is currently informal. Systematize it:
Post-episode follow-up (Day 14 email): 'Know an IT leader who should be on the show? Know someone who could use a second set of eyes on their vendors?'
Post-advisory engagement: 'If this was valuable, who else in your network is dealing with similar challenges?'
Community-driven: Monthly 'bring a peer' invitation to roundtables.

Industry Event Outreach (LinkedIn Events Play)
Detailed in Section 10.3. Reps register for relevant LinkedIn events, gain messaging access to attendees and interested non-attendees, and outreach with roundtable notes or survey invitations.

Inbound from Content Engine
Once the content repurposing engine is running (Section 9), social media posts with CTAs will generate inbound inquiries. Reps handle these as warm leads since the prospect has already engaged with YBH content. Route to scorecard, 1:1, or podcast invitation based on the prospect's expressed interest.

5.4 Future Avatar: CEO/CFO (Phase E)
The campaign system should be designed with future expansion to CEO and CFO audiences in mind. This is not adversarial positioning. The goal is to create episodes and content that speak to the business frustrations executive teams have with technology decisions, making the conversation more well-rounded and helping IT leaders get heard by addressing both sides. CEO/CFO content could include episodes like 'What Your CTO Wishes You Knew About IT Spend' or 'Why Your IT Budget Is Actually an Investment, Not a Cost Center.' This avatar expansion is flagged as Phase E and should not distract from the current IT leader focus.

6. Campaign System Architecture
The campaign system serves two functions: amplifying the existing podcast pipeline and creating parallel entry points for prospects who haven't entered the podcast funnel. Both paths ultimately route to one of three outcomes: a podcast guest invitation, a one-on-one with Phil, or a micro-commitment (scorecard, brief download, community join) that nurtures toward the first two.

6.1 The Podcast as Central Engine
Everything orbits the podcast. It is not one channel among many; it is the engine that powers the entire business. The campaign system's job is to make the engine more efficient (better CTAs, better content utilization, better follow-up) and to catch prospects the engine misses (people who need advisory help but aren't natural podcast guests).

6.2 Three-Tier Value Ladder
Tier 1: Vendor Reality Briefs (Top of Funnel)
Short, insight-dense documents (2-4 pages) that distill real vendor intelligence into actionable comparison guides. These are the 'free taste' of the advisory's analytical depth. Example: A sanitized version of the Coleman Health MSSP analysis, with company names removed but vendor comparisons, weighted scoring methodology, and TCO frameworks intact. When an IT leader downloads this brief, they see exactly what a full advisory engagement produces. The brief includes a CTA to book a one-on-one.

Vertical-specific briefs planned:
Cybersecurity: MSSP Vendor Comparison Framework (based on Coleman Health analysis)
Microsoft: Licensing Agreement Comparison (EA vs. CSP vs. NCE)
Network: SD-WAN Vendor Evaluation (based on existing case studies)
Telecom/CX: Contact Center Migration Guide (UCaaS vendor comparison)

Tier 2: Interactive Scorecards (Middle of Funnel)
Fillout-powered self-assessment tools that help IT leaders evaluate their own vendor relationships and infrastructure. These capture qualification data (tech stack, pain points, contract timing) while providing genuine value. Results are delivered instantly with a personalized recommendation and CTA to discuss findings with Phil.

Scorecards planned:
Cyber Sleep Score: 5 questions evaluating MSSP effectiveness. 'Is your security vendor earning their paycheck?'
Microsoft Licensing Health Check: Questions about current agreement type, seat count, usage patterns. Reveals whether the client is overpaying.
Vendor Reality Check: Broader 7-question diagnostic covering internet, security, Microsoft, telecom, mobile. Updated version of the existing Reality Check (currently broken).

Tier 3: Roundtables (Bottom of Funnel)
Monthly facilitated discussions hosted in the Circle community on specific topics (security layering, AI implementation, Microsoft licensing strategies). These function as content creation engines (each roundtable generates multiple briefs, carousels, quote cards, and articles), peer networking events (attendees build relationships that increase retention), and soft qualification (who shows up for what topic reveals their concerns). Roundtables should be promoted through email, LinkedIn, PRF CTAs, and podcast episodes.

7. Vertical Campaign Hooks
Each vertical has a primary hook (the emotional/financial trigger that gets attention), a brief topic, a scorecard concept, and a case study reference. These hooks appear in PRF CTAs, email sequences, LinkedIn posts, website landing pages, and audio ads.

7.1 Cybersecurity / MSSP

7.2 Microsoft Licensing

7.3 Network / SD-WAN / ISP

7.4 Telecom / CX / Contact Center

7.5 Mobile Carrier Management

7.6 Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)

7.7 General / Value Discovery

8. PRF CTA Strategy (Overview)
The PRF is delivered to every podcast guest and is designed to be shared widely. It is the single most-viewed marketing asset YBH produces. Currently it has zero CTAs. The strategy calls for 7 sidebar CTAs, each using a different psychological trigger and routing to a different action.


8.1 The 7 CTAs (Strategic Summary)

8.2 Rotation Strategy
Show 3-4 CTAs per PRF page view, not all 7. Always show CTA 1 (case study, strongest proof) and CTA 7 (community, lowest-friction catch-all). Rotate CTAs 2-6 based on the guest's pre-podcast Sanity Check data. If they mentioned security concerns, show CTA 2. Microsoft pain, show CTA 3. Contract timing, show CTA 4. If no Sanity Check data is available, the default rotation is CTA 1, CTA 5 (Reality Check), CTA 3 (Microsoft, universally relevant), and CTA 7.

8.3 Content Repurposing Integration
When PRF content (infographics, carousels, quote cards) is repurposed and posted on social media, the posts should tag the guest and include a link back to the full PRF, which now contains CTAs. This creates a continuous loop: social post drives traffic to PRF, PRF drives traffic to scorecards and 1:1 bookings. The guest benefits from expanded personal brand reach, and YBH benefits from CTA exposure in the guest's network.

9. Content Repurposing Engine
YBH has 9 years and 390+ episodes of content that is currently used once on release day and never again. This is the single largest untapped asset in the business. The content repurposing engine transforms each episode into 15-20 pieces of social content, keeps guests tagged and visible, and drives ongoing traffic to PRF pages (which now have CTAs) and advisory landing pages.

9.1 Per-Episode Content Output
Each episode should produce the following content pieces, leveraging AI tools as much as possible:
3-5 quote card images (guest's strongest insights with YBH branding)
2-3 carousel posts (multi-slide LinkedIn/Instagram format summarizing key takeaways)
1 infographic (visual summary of the episode's core thesis)
2-3 short video clips (30-90 second highlights for LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels)
1 article/blog post (long-form written version of key insights for SEO and website content)
3-5 standalone social media posts (text-only insights for LinkedIn, X/Twitter)
1 newsletter segment (for email distribution to the 6K list)

9.2 Tagging and Distribution Strategy
Every social media post that uses a guest's content should tag the guest. This serves three purposes:
Reminds the guest that YBH exists and keeps the advisory top of mind.
Expands reach into the guest's network. When a CTO shares or engages with a post about their episode, their connections (other IT leaders) see YBH.
Drives traffic back to the PRF page, which now has CTAs. The social post becomes a lead generation touchpoint.

9.3 Backlog Processing
The 390+ episode backlog should be processed in priority order:
Most recent 50 episodes first (freshest, most engaged guests, most current topics).
Episodes featuring guests who became advisory clients (case study potential).
Episodes with high download/listen counts (proven audience interest).
Evergreen topic episodes (security layering, Microsoft licensing, AI in IT, leadership communication).

The integrator is already working on the content library and delivery system. This engine should be a primary focus once the PRF CTAs and basic infrastructure are in place.

10. LinkedIn Strategy
10.1 Phil's Profile Optimization
Phil's LinkedIn profile (17,862 followers, linkedin.com/in/popularit/) is the most important conversion asset outside the podcast itself. Recommended changes:

Featured Section (Highest Priority)
Currently has one link (youvebeenheard.com). Should have 3-4 items:
7 Questions Reality Check (once rebuilt and working). This is the highest-conversion asset.
A recent compelling episode link.
A case study or Vendor Reality Brief (once built).
Community invite link.

Headline Refinement
Current headline is Phil-centric (describes what Phil does). Consider shifting the middle section to prospect benefit. Suggested revision: 'Host, You've Been Heard (#2 Enterprise IT Podcast) | Free Gartner-Level Vendor Intelligence for Mid-Market IT Leaders | Make IT Boring Again.' Social proof stays, but the middle section shifts to what the prospect gets.

About Section
Add a podcast guest invitation line somewhere visible: 'If you're an IT leader with stories worth sharing, DM me. We're always looking for the next voice.' Also consider front-loading the advisory value proposition (what the prospect gets) before the storytelling and philosophy sections. The 'DMs welcome' closing CTA should remain.

Experience Reordering
Consider moving the SD-WAN / Hard Reboot Networking position lower. It's very network-specific and may cause prospects to think Phil is a network specialist rather than a broad advisory partner. The Vendor Neutral Advisor and Community positions should be more prominent.

Banner Update
FeedSpot badge currently says '2025.' If a 2026 version is available, swap it.

10.2 Rep Profile Standards
Rep profiles are nearly identical to Phil's without the additional Experience sections. Ensure all rep profiles include:
Title: 'Behind the Scenes Coordinator' (not salesperson, not BDR, not SDR).
Headline referencing You've Been Heard podcast.
About section explaining that they recruit IT leaders for the podcast.
Link to Phil's video or the podcast guest application.

10.3 LinkedIn Outreach Strategy
In addition to the direct recruitment outreach documented in the sales process (Section 4), there are two advanced LinkedIn plays to implement after the foundation is built:

LinkedIn Events Play (Tyron Giuliani Method)
Find industry events on LinkedIn (Gartner IT Symposium, local ISSA chapters, HIMSS, etc.). Register to attend. LinkedIn grants messaging access to all attendees and non-attendees who expressed interest. Message non-attendees: 'Saw you were interested in [Event]. We're covering similar topics on our podcast and have a private community of 181+ CTOs discussing this regularly. Want the notes from our last roundtable on [topic]?' This bypasses normal LinkedIn messaging restrictions and connects with people already interested in the topic.

LinkedIn Content Strategy
Once the content repurposing engine is running, Phil and reps should post 3-5 times per week on LinkedIn with repurposed episode content, always tagging the guest. This maintains visibility, generates inbound, and feeds the podcast pipeline with organic interest.

11. Email Strategy
11.1 List Segmentation

11.2 Podcast Guest Re-Engagement Sequence
The 350 podcast guest list has 45% open rate but poor click-through. This is a copywriting and CTA problem, not an engagement problem. These people already trust YBH. The re-engagement sequence should:
Email 1: Value-first. Share a Vendor Reality Brief relevant to their industry. No ask.
Email 2: Case study. 'Since your episode, we helped Trinity Health Centers save $1.872M. Here's how.' Includes 1:1 booking CTA.
Email 3: Community reminder. 'The community has grown to 181+ CTOs since you recorded. Here's what they discussed last month.' Includes join link.
Email 4: Direct ask. 'Any contracts up for renewal? We offer a free vendor review as a thank-you for being on the show.' 1:1 CTA.
Email 5: Referral ask. 'Know an IT leader who should be on the show? Know someone who could use a second set of eyes on their vendors? Intro us.'

11.3 General List Re-Engagement
The 6,000-person list must be scrubbed before use (remove bounces, unsubscribes, invalid domains). After scrubbing:
Email 1: Reintroduction. 'You've Been Heard has evolved. Here's what's new.' Highlights podcast, community, advisory. CTA to listen to a specific episode.
Email 2: Brief download. Vertical-specific Vendor Reality Brief with form capture to update profile data.
Email 3: Scorecard invitation. 'Take the Cyber Sleep Score' or 'Check Your Microsoft Licensing' depending on vertical interest.
Email 4: Podcast invitation. 'We're looking for IT leaders to feature on the show. Interested?'

Anyone who doesn't engage after 4 emails goes to a low-frequency monthly newsletter. Do not burn this list with aggressive outreach.

11.4 Post-Episode Automated Sequence
Triggered in GHL after each new episode publishes. Sent to the guest:
Day 0: PRF delivery email with embedded CTAs.
Day 3: 'Your episode is live. Here are the assets we created for you.' Includes sharing links and tagging instructions.
Day 7: Community invitation reminder.
Day 14: 'Did you need help with anything we discussed?' References specific pain points from Sanity Check if available.
Day 30: Case study or brief relevant to their vertical.
Day 60: Contract timing check-in if renewal window was mentioned.

12. Website Recommendations
12.1 Immediate Fixes (Phase A)
Fix the broken advisory link. Both the nav link and the 'Start here' button point to a 404. Either rebuild the page at the current URL or redirect to a new landing page.
Update the '7 questions' copy to match the actual current process (3 questions plus Phil's video, or rebuild the 7-question diagnostic as the Vendor Reality Check scorecard in Fillout).
Update footer copyright from 2025 to 2026.

12.2 Advisory Section Rebuild
The current advisory section has three abstract value props (Buying Power, Performance, Funds) and a broken CTA. Replace with:
Concrete explanation of what the advisory does (the lifecycle management visual from the onboarding deck).
Case studies with real numbers: Trinity Health ($1.872M saved, IT spend to $30K/month), Steve Goudreau (Microsoft licensing savings), Coleman Health (5-vendor MSSP evaluation with weighted scoring).
The 'Make IT Boring Again' philosophy with clear explanation of what it means.
Working CTA: Either a rebuilt Reality Check scorecard or a direct 1:1 booking link.

12.3 Vertical Landing Pages (Phase C)
Each vertical needs a dedicated landing page to receive traffic from PRF CTAs, email campaigns, LinkedIn posts, and eventually paid ads. Each page should include: the vertical-specific hook, a brief download behind a Fillout form, a relevant case study, a scorecard CTA, and a 1:1 booking fallback CTA.

12.4 Tracking Infrastructure
LinkedIn Insight Tag: Install on all website pages for LinkedIn retargeting and conversion tracking.
Google Analytics 4: Configure event tracking for all CTA clicks, form submissions, and page views.
UTM parameters: Standardize across all channels (see UTM framework in Appendix).
Fillout form submissions: Route to GHL via webhook for lead scoring and automation triggers.

13. Lead Generation Infrastructure
13.1 Tech Stack

13.2 GHL Pipeline Structure
Rebuild GHL with three core pipelines:
Pipeline 1: Podcast Recruitment
Stages: Prospect Identified, Connection Sent, Connected, Interest Expressed, Video Watched, Questions Answered, Onboarding Call Scheduled, Onboarding Complete, Recording Scheduled, Recorded, PRF Delivered, Follow-Up Complete.
Pipeline 2: Advisory Leads

14. Advertising and Paid Media

14.1 Organic First (Phases A-C)
All initial effort focuses on organic channels: LinkedIn content posting, email sequences, PRF CTAs, community growth, and content repurposing. These channels have zero media cost and leverage existing assets.

14.2 LinkedIn Paid Ads (Phase D-E)
When ready, LinkedIn ads should target the same Sales Navigator audiences with sponsored content promoting Vendor Reality Briefs, scorecard invitations, and podcast episodes. LinkedIn conversation ads (direct message format) can promote roundtable invitations. Start with a small test budget ($500-$1,000/month) on a single vertical (cybersecurity or Microsoft, whichever has the strongest organic results) and scale based on cost per lead.

14.3 Podcast Audio Ads (Existing)
Currently running a few short ads promoting ISP aggregation and telecom. 3 leads over time. Recommendations:
Rotate ad topics across verticals once landing pages exist (cybersecurity, Microsoft, general advisory).
Keep ads short (30-60 seconds) and conversational, matching the podcast tone.
Each ad drives to a specific vertical landing page with UTM tracking.
Test a 'Make IT Boring Again' brand ad that promotes the platform generally rather than a specific vertical.
