# You've Been Heard (YBH) - Context

## Strategy Doc
- Full strategy V2.0 saved at: `/root/clawd/projects/ybh-strategy-v2.md`
- Prepared Feb 2, 2026 with help from Anthropic co-worker
- 19 sections covering full marketing/growth playbook

## What It Is
- **#2 Enterprise IT Podcast** - real conversations with IT leaders
- **Vendor-free community** - peers without sales pressure
- **Vendor-neutral advisory** - validate spend, risk, vendor fit

## Business Model
- Vendor-funded through channel residuals (long-tail economics)
- Only profitable if decisions hold up (bad advice costs them money)
- Churn under 3%
- $1.2B in buying power

## The Team
- **Phil** - Visionary/Founder
- **Greg** - Integrator (AI side) - $4-5K/month (Jan 2025 raise)
- **Zubair** (Nigeria) - Execution, human-in-the-loop
- **5 brothers** - Sales team

## Core Positioning
- "Make IT boring again" (infrastructure, licensing, contracts, vendor noise)
- Philosophy: quiet systems → clear decisions

## Three Pillars
1. **Podcast** - amplify IT leaders, build trust, open doors
2. **Community** - real dialogue, no vendors lurking
3. **Advisory** - your performance and sanity, vetted choices

## Sales Layers
1. **Low-Hanging Fruit** (entry) - internet, MS licensing, firewalls, telecom
2. **Vendor-Neutral Advisory** (core) - validate spend/risk/vendor fit
3. **Strategic Advisory** (earned) - cloud, ERP, AI, security architecture

## Brand Voice Rules
- **NO em dashes** - use periods instead
- **One line = one complete thought**
- **Clear, not clever**
- Short sentences, punchy
- Use contractions
- Witty without being cute

### Words to USE
- Battle/military: frontlines, trenches, firefights
- Real talk: "sucks the least," "the ugly truth"
- Human: sanity, lonely, frustrated, exhausted
- Anti-vendor: sales circus, quota-chasers, vendor mediocrity

### Words to AVOID
- Corporate: synergy, leverage, optimize, solutions
- AI-flagged: delve, enhance, robust, comprehensive, transformative, elevate, embrace, empower, foster, harness, navigate, seamlessly, tapestry, testament
- Hype: revolutionary, cutting-edge, game-changing

## Key Lines
- "We stay. We escalate. We stand with you."
- "Vendor-neutral? If we were any more neutral, we'd be beige."
- "We don't sell. We unsell."
- "Having a seat at the table. Nice. Being heard? Nicer."
