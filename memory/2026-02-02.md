## TTS Configuration
- Switched from Edge TTS to **OpenAI TTS**
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini-tts`
- Voice: `echo` (Greg's choice after testing nova and onyx)
- API key added to `messages.tts.openai.apiKey` (was missing before, causing fallback to Edge)
- Cost: ~$0.015/minute

## Phil Howard Message
- Sent voice message + text to Phil Howard (+1 202 903-4728) on WhatsApp
- Phil = Greg's colleague on YBH podcast (US-based)
- Topic: LinkedIn automation idea - searching qualified connections, managing Sales Navigator lists, commenting with podcast references
- Important: Do NOT mention TeachInspire to Phil
- Introduced myself as Pinch, kept details vague about our setup

## OpenClaw macOS Node Setup (in progress)
- Greg installing OpenClaw macOS app (v2026.1.30) to connect to my gateway
- My gateway: v2026.1.24-3 @ 89.167.10.119:18789
- Transport: SSH tunnel (Greg's SSH key added to authorized_keys)
- SSH key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKKmTGUDg0JWFTo6jHUNkHfQzHFJNdqoYFBB1FU7n5/e greg@popularit.net`
- Gateway auth token set: `40e16d8a336784d19d0aa11e9ea28f2a048d3eb522aad423aad70d1b77b86742`
- Issue: Version mismatch between app and gateway causing "client/id" protocol error
- Trying CLI node approach with env var for token

## Greg's Ideas
- Wants to embed AI assistant (like me) into his podcast production web app
- Features: episode scheduling, social media distribution, notifications
- Has existing scheduler API
- Recommendation: Start with webhook integration (me controlling via API), then build native later if needed

## Contacts
- Phil Howard: +1 (202) 903-4728 (WhatsApp) - YBH podcast colleague, US
