# 2026-02-05 — Discord HQ Launch

## Major: Migrated from Telegram to Discord
- Guild ID: 1469102100330844256
- Created full channel structure for TeachInspire Growth team:
  - 📋 TEACHINSPIRE GROWTH: #dashboard, #standup, #strategy
  - 🦞 CONTENT — Omar: #content-tasks, #content-ideas
  - 🐙 PROSPECTING — Octo: #leads, #market-intel
  - 🦪 SALES — Pearl: #outreach, #deals
  - ⚙️ OPS — Pinch: #pinch-log, #integrations
- Dashboard channel: 1469114425587007511
- Posted Sprint 1 announcement to dashboard

## PRD: TeachInspire Growth Kanban
- Wrote full PRD at projects/teachinspire/PRD-kanban.md
- Copied to Obsidian vault: TeachInspire/PRD-kanban.md
- Greg gave it to AI coding agent to build
- Modeled after YBH Kanban but extended with: sprints, epics, agent swimlanes, growth metrics, Discord webhooks

## Sprint 1 Priority (Greg's direction)
- FIRST: Get website running + finish training content
- THEN: Shift to prospecting and client acquisition
- Not starting outreach until foundations are solid

## Security Incident
- GitHub PAT (ghp_NB5o...) was exposed in MEMORY.md and memory/2026-02-03.md
- GitHub push protection blocked pushes
- Fixed with git-filter-repo to scrub entire history
- Greg revoked old PAT, generated new one
- New PAT stored in git remote URL only, NOT in files
- Greg accidentally posted new PAT in Discord #general — told him to delete it
- Lesson: secrets via WhatsApp DM only, never in Discord channels

## Greg went to sleep ~00:05 UTC (01:05 Morocco time)
