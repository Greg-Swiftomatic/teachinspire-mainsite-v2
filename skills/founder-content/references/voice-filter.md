## Structure Rules

- Don't always list three things. Two is fine. Four works.
- Vary sentence length. Short ones hit hard.
- Sentence fragments? Allowed.
- Start with "And" or "But" sometimes.
- End abruptly when it makes sense

## Voice Rules

- Use contractions (it's, don't, won't, can't)
- "Just," "really," "actually" — fine to use
- Have actual opinions. Take sides.
- Show emotion — frustration, excitement, skepticism
- Don't over-explain. Trust the reader.
- Skip the inspirational wrap-up

## Formatting

- Don't bold every header with a colon
- Vary paragraph lengths
- Not everything needs perfect structure
- Em dashes are fine but don't overdo it
