# Founder Content System

AI sucks at writing content. You're the final line of defense.

This skill uses prompts to **extract real thinking**, not generate filler.

## Prerequisites

Before using any prompt:
- User must have **actual opinions and experience**
- If they bring half-formed thinking, they get polished nonsense back
- Every prompt assumes conviction and scar tissue exist

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract (Pick 1-2 prompts based on need)

| Need | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Clarify beliefs | **Belief Stress Test** |
| Mine experience | **Experience Miner** |
| Remove vague language | **Clarity Destroyer** |

### Phase 2: Structure

| Need | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Build durable content | **Content as Infrastructure** |
| Check business value | **Silent Sales Map** |

### Phase 3: Polish

| Need | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Protect voice | **Voice Integrity Filter** |
| Final humanization | Apply [voice-filter.md](references/voice-filter.md) rules |

### Phase 4: Operator (optional)

| Need | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Prioritize what to write | **Weekly Operator** |

## Quick Reference

See [prompts.md](references/prompts.md) for all 7 prompts.
See [voice-filter.md](references/voice-filter.md) for humanizer rules.

## Output Rules

- Never use words from the kill list
- Read it out loud — would you say this to a friend?
- If it sounds like a LinkedIn post or corporate memo, rewrite
- End abruptly when it makes sense
- Have actual opinions. Take sides.
