# TeachInspire Illustration Style Guide

> "The moment before understanding — held gently."

Contemplative, meditative, reflective. Illustrations that breathe. Visual haikus for educators.

## Aesthetic Principles

### 1. Silence & Space
- 60-70% of the canvas is breathing room
- White/cream negative space is active, not empty
- One idea per image — fully felt, never cluttered

### 2. Scale & Solitude
- Small figures in vast environments
- The learner dwarfed by possibility, not overwhelmed
- Intimate moments in open space

### 3. Stillness & Interiority
- Capture the pause, not the action
- Someone thinking, absorbing, wondering
- The inner work of learning made visible

### 4. Light & Warmth
- Single point of warm light (golden yellow)
- Knowledge arriving gently — illumination as gift
- Soft, not dramatic — dawn, not spotlight

## Visual Specifications

### Color Palette

| Element | Hex Code | Usage |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Background | `#f8f7f2` | Warm cream — the breathing space |
| Primary | `#85a2a3` | Muted teal — lines, shapes, figures |
| Accent (spark) | `#f1d263` | Soft gold — used sparingly, the moment of insight |
| Lines | `#2c3d57` | Dark slate — outlines and definition |

### Line Quality
- Clean, minimal strokes
- Subtle crosshatching for texture (hand-drawn feel)
- Sketch-like but intentional

### Figures
- Faceless or minimally featured
- Simple, universal forms
- Body language carries emotion

### Composition
- Asymmetrical balance
- Figures often lower third, looking up or inward
- Conceptual/metaphorical elements float naturally

## AI Image Generation Prompt Template

```
Minimalist contemplative illustration in the style of Sempé and Christoph Niemann.

[SCENE DESCRIPTION]

Visual style: Clean line art, subtle crosshatching texture, faceless simplified figures. Vast white/cream negative space (60-70% of image). Small figure in open environment.

Color palette: Muted teal-grey (#85a2a3), warm cream background (#f8f7f2), single golden accent (#f1d263) as focal point of warmth/insight.

Mood: Meditative, reflective, quiet. A moment of stillness — someone thinking, absorbing, wondering. Poetic, not explanatory. The silence between thoughts.

No clutter. No text. No busy details. Let the image breathe.

## Example Scene Prompts

### Learning / Discovery
A small figure sits alone at a desk in a vast cream space. Above them, a soft teal cloud releases geometric shapes that drift down like gentle rain toward a tiny golden lightbulb glowing above their head. In the far background, a faint sketch of a teacher at a board. Contemplative, still, meditative.

### Teacher as Guide
A vast cream space. A small figure stands at the edge, looking across toward a distant doorway filled with soft golden light. Faint teal lines suggest a path. No rush. The journey inward. Sempé-style simplicity.

### The Spark
A single figure sitting cross-legged in endless white space. Eyes closed. Above their head, one small golden spark. Around them, very faint teal geometric shapes suspended mid-air. Stillness. The moment before understanding.

### Connection
Two small figures sit across from each other at a simple table in vast cream emptiness. Between them, a soft teal thread connects. One tiny golden glow where the thread meets. Quiet conversation. Listening visible.

## Reference Artists

| Artist | What to borrow |
|--------|----------------|
| Sempé | Scale, solitude, warmth, wit |
| Christoph Niemann | Conceptual clarity, one-idea-per-image |
| Shaun Tan | Weight of unspoken meaning |
| Saul Steinberg | Line as thought |
| Guy Billout | Surreal calm, quiet absurdism |

---

## What to Avoid

- Busy compositions
- Multiple competing focal points
- Literal/explanatory imagery
- Aggressive colors or high contrast
- Detailed faces
- Corporate clip-art energy
- "Excited" or "dynamic" poses

---

## The Test

Before finalizing any illustration, ask:

> **Does this image invite pause — or demand attention?**

If it demands, simplify. If it invites, it's right.
