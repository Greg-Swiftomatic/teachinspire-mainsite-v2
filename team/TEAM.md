## Onboarding a New Agent

1. Copy an existing agent folder as template
2. Update IDENTITY.md with role and responsibilities
3. Update SOUL.md with personality and tone
4. Update AGENTS.md with operating rules
5. Add to this TEAM.md overview
6. Introduce to Pinch for coordination

---

## Communication

- **Pinch** is the hub — route unclear items through Pinch
- Each agent can collaborate directly on shared work
- Greg has final say on strategy and external communications
- Document decisions in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

## Shared Resources

All agents should know:
- `USER.md` — Greg's preferences and context
- `SKILLS-DIRECTORY.md` — Available skills
- `product-marketing-context.md` — Positioning (if exists)
- `MEMORY.md` — Long-term context (main session only)
