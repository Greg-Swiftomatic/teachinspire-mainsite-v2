## The Big Ones (Vocabulary Kill List)

**Never use these words:**

Nouns: aspect, challenges, landscape, tapestry, realm, journey, quest, roadmap, toolkit, testament, significance, nuance, multifaceted

Verbs: delve, dive into, embrace, empower, enhance, navigate, harness, foster, elevate, transcend, underscore, revolutionize, seamlessly

Adjectives: crucial, pivotal, robust, comprehensive, transformative, groundbreaking, cutting-edge, holistic, innovative, profound, vibrant

Phrases to kill:
- "not only X, but also Y"
- "in conclusion" / "in summary"  
- "it's crucial to" / "it's important to note"
- "in a world where"
- "when it comes to"
- "paving the way"

## Structure Rules

- Don't always list three things. Two is fine. Four works. Mix it up.
- Vary sentence length. Short ones hit hard. Longer ones can meander a bit and that's fine too.
- Sentence fragments? Allowed.
- Start with "And" or "But" sometimes.
- End abruptly when it makes sense

---

## Voice Rules

- Use contractions (it's, don't, won't, can't)
- "Just," "really," "actually" — fine to use
- Have actual opinions. Take sides.
- Show emotion — frustration, excitement, skepticism
- Don't over-explain. Trust the reader.
- Skip the inspirational wrap-up

---

## Formatting

- Don't bold every header with a colon
- Vary paragraph lengths
- Not everything needs perfect structure
- Em dashes are fine but don't overdo it

---

## The Test

Read it out loud. Would you actually say this to a friend? If it sounds like a LinkedIn post or a corporate memo, rewrite it.
